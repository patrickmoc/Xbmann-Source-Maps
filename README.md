# Xbmann-Source-Maps
Repository for the source files of the maps that I've worked on
Every folder contains all vmf files I have access to as well as a finished bsp from which you can extract assets.
 - CSS contains all work I have done for Counter Strike mapping
 - TF2 contains (almost) all work I have done for Team Fortress 2
 - Misc contains other odd vmfs as well as abandoned / unused projects
